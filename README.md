1.What is the difference between print and return in Python?

print shows output on the screen immediately, but return sends a value back from a function to be used later in the program. For example, print(5) just shows 5, while return 5 allows the function to give 5 to other parts of the code.

2.Are there any known bugs or issues with your program?

No.

3.Describe an issue that was encountered and resolved when writing and testing the code.

At first, the program did not give the correct grades because wrong comparison signs were used in the if statements. The conditions to check if a number was between two values were incorrect. After fixing the signs to use less than and greater than properly, the program works correctly.
